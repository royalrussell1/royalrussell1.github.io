            <em style="color: #87cefa; font-size: 30px;"> As there are many different types of dolphins, their habitat
                varies to all around the world. However, one thing all Dolphins have in common
                is the fact that they all tend to stay in the shallow parts of the oceans, although some do like deep
                waters. They are also found in both hot and cold temperatures, with different
                species preferring different temperatures. They can also be found in rivers. For example, pink dolphins
                usually stay in the Amazon and Orinoco River,
                both located in South America. In terms of oceans, Dolphins can be found in most seas around the world.
                These include the Pacific, Meditteranean and Atlantic Ocean, alongside both the
                Black and Red Seas. Visit the link at the top of the page to find out an interesting story about how
                Dolphins can identify their friends!
