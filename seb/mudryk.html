Mykhailo mudryk (23) is a Ukrainian international football player. When he arrived at the blues,
 he started with a bang against liverpool showing off breathtaking pace. After the fist match, 
 Mudryk started to drop off and was described as a flop by many harsh football critics but recently
  he has started to pick up form getting six goal contributions within the first half of the season. 
  Mudryk is a promising prospect for Chelsea's future if fortune goes his way.
