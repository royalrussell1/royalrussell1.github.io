    <h2>Although turtles have been around for millions of years, recent human activities have started to 
        threaten the turtle population. <br><br>One of the major threats is plastic pollution.
        When humans don't throw away their plastic waste responsibily, and it blows into the ocean many 
        sea creatures and birds can get caught up in the plastic which can lead to strangulation or
        starvation. However, turtles are affected especially, as many sea turtles rely on
        jellyfish as their main source of food. The turtles often mistake plastic bags and other pieces 
        of plastic for the jellyfish, which leads to many of them dying due to plastic pollution. Some sources
        even suggest that over 1000 turtles are killed each year from eating plastic. <br><br> Another reason
        for why turtles are becoming more and more endangered is global warming. Certain human activities like burning 
        fossil fuels, using non-renewable energy and wasting electricty/water releases greenhouse gases that trap the 
        Earth's heat in the atmosphere, causing it to get warmer. This leads to warmer sea temperatures and this can cause 
        turtles to die because the temperature is too hot.
