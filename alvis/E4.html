               Muskets
           </h1></u>
           Muskets were invented in the early 16th century. They were the first type of gun to be ever invented. It works by igniting gunpowder and using it to propel a projectile at very high speeds. However, gunpowder was already invented a long time before in China. Muskets typically fired a single shot, then needed a long reload time.
           They were used widely by most armies in the world until the late 18th and early 19th century, when much more modern rifles were invented.

            Cannons and Field Artillery
        </h1></u>
        <p>
Cannons were first invented in about the 13th century, in China. These were large cannons, mounted on large wheels to be moved around easier. They were very powerful with each blow and can fire from massive distances. They would be used for sieges, destory walls and during infantry battles to blow up enemies.
They were also widely used by most European Armies, although having some modifications, lasted even during WW1, untl it was replaced with better artillery and autocannons.

            Grenades and Grenadiers
        </h1></u>
        <p>
The first grenades were invented in the Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire), around 700 AD. Grendaes are small handheld-explosives, filled with gunpowder and shrapnel. Renaissance grenades were usually made out of iron or cermaic. Now, modern grenades are much different. Some early designs involved tying an explosive to the end of a stick and then throwing it. Now, one of the most famous grenades are fragmentation grenades, where the shoot out shrapnel everywhere on explosion. There are other types, like smoke, impact, and more.
