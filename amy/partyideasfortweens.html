                    a good balance of candy, popcorn, crisps and chocolate will be a good option to
                    ensure that there is something there for everyone. On a summer evening, you could
                    set up some camp chairs, cushions, a projector and a screen in your back garden.

                    out of selection so that they get the real feeling as if they are at a cinema or
                    theatre. A movie night party is great for all ages and can be altered to suit
                    different guests by the movie, snacks and general atmosphere.
