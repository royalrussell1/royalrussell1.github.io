                <mark><strong>A brief introduction to netball:</strong></mark>
                <br>
                <p><p><img src="gilbertnetball.jpg" alt="Netball" style="float:right;width:200px;height:200px;">Netball first began in 1895 and an official world netball
                    cup began in 1963. Since then, netball has become a world renowned sport
                    mainly played by women but men too and is often competed at between high schools.
                    It is a sport played between two teams of seven players on a rectangular court
                    split into thirds. At the beginning of the game, the ball starts in the centre third
                    in the hands of which ever team has won a game of rock paper scissors. There wil then be
                    a goal at either end of the court and at the beginning of the game, each team will be 
                    assigned a goal to shoot in. The players will then have to pass the ball down the court
                    without dropping the ball, without moving whilst holding the ball and only holding the ball for 
                    a maximum for three seconds. While one team does this, the opposing team will defend
                    the team and attempt to get the ball to tak it down to their post. There are seven players
                    each with different positions that will either be on their bib or attached to their netball dresses
                    (which we will look at later) and they can only go in certain areas of the court otherwise the ball will 
                    go to the other team. The ball could also be given to the other team if one team hits the ball 
                    outside the court or they move whilst holding the ball. Other netball offences are getting too close 
                    to the player holding the ball or touching the player or ball. This is known as obstruction and multiple
                    serious occasions of this will lead to being sent off. There are three atacking positions,
                three defending positions and one all rounder.</p>

                    <mark><strong>What are the seven different positions in netball and what do they do?</strong></mark>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Centre (C) Centre is an important position not only because they start off the game
                            but becuase they are allowed virtually everywhere on court! They are marked by the other team's
                            centre and are tasked at helping to move the ball down the court to hopefully assist a goal.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Wing Attack (WA) Wing attack is a similar position to centre as it helps to
                            transport the ball alongside the centre through most of the court. This position
                            is allowed in the centre third and the shooting third but not the d area and it is marked by wing defence.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Goal Attack (GA) Goal attack is one of the two shooters per team and is allowed to
                            go in the shooting third and the centre third. This position is marked by the other team's goal 
                            defence and has to to try to catch the ball in a suitable place inside the d to shoot.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Goal Shooter (GS) Goal shooter is the second of the team's shooters who is allowed in only their 
                            shoting third. They are marked by the opposing team's goal keeper who will attempt to prevent them
                            from reciving the ball inside the d and shooting. You are only able to shoot from inside the d.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Wing Defence (WD) Wing defence marks wing attack and is supposed to attempt to stop their WA from 
                            getting the ball and passing it. They can do this by intercepting the pass or applying pressure to the 
                            ball. This player can go in the other team's shooting third, the centre third but not the d.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Goal Defence (GD) Goal defence marks goal attack and should try to intercept the ball straight 
                            after the centre third and pass it to ther team members. Inside the d, the GD needs to stay tightly
                            on their player and lift their arms up - but stay 3 feet away - when they are shooting. They can go in 
                            the other team's shooting third and the centre third.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Goal Keeper (GK) Goal keeper is really the last line of defence before the opposing team can take 
                            a shot at the hoop. If the WD and GD have not managed to get the ball from the other team yet, the GK
                            needs to try and prevent it from entering the d by marking very closely. They can go in the other team's shooting third.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                        <mark><strong>What do people wear for netball?</strong></mark>
                        <br>
                        <p>Most netballers wear a special team netball dress when they reach high level netball and are playing
                            for a major team. They are tight around the body and are made out of a sporty lycra material so 
                            that it is breathable when the athlete is hot. These dresses have been made with both function
                            and style in mind which looks very organised as well as neat when all the players are wearing matching
                            outfits. On their feet, netballers wear comfortable trainers, a good brand for specifically netball trainers
                            is Asics. They sell a whole range of netball trainers for both inside and outside with a smooth foam underneath
                            so that the athletes can run with stability. Below are a few examples of netball dresses and trainers
                            as well as a link to the Asics website.
