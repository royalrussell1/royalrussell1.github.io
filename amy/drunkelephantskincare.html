        <h1>Drunk Elephant Skincare</h1>
        <mark><strong>Recently, there has been a lot of stories in the news of young tweens
            and teens using harmful products on their skin that can effect them
            in the long run. It made me think about what products I am using on my
            skin and how I can protect myself from dangerous things on my young skin. 
            In the following blog I will be looking at some brands and particular
            products that won't threaten to destroy my skin. The particular brand we
          are going to be looking at is Drunk Elephant, it is currently going viral on TikTok for many
        reasons and we are going to work out if it is worth the hype! I bought some of 
      these products so that I can investigate them, I will tell you if you should save 
    or splurge!</strong></mark>

                Drunk Elephant is currently an incredibly popular skincare brand that has blown up on TikTok. The company is named after
            a commonly used item in their skincare called marula oil. There is a myth that when elephants drink the juice from the marula 
            fruit, they supposedly act as though they are drunk. So there you have the name - Drunk Elephant! The brand is especially 
            famous for their 'bronzi drops' which are a tinted serum and give your skin a blonzer glowy look without being too cakey.
        They are also well known for their 'skincare smoothies' which is where you take one of their moisturisers, these are cleverly 
        designed to pump out product, and add in other serums. it is said that any of their serums are compatible with their moisturisers
    and teenagers are going crazy to make them. It is a very smart marketing pull and it is one of the reasons that this brand has gone viral.
Tiffany Masterson, the brand creator, designed her products so that they did not include any of the 'suspicous six' in the formula. These six
ingredients that she came up with are dangerous to the skin but for some reason are still found in some other brand's products.</p>
<br>
<mark><strong> What are the suspicous six?</strong></mark>
<ol>
    <li>Essential Oils</li>
    <li>Alchohol</li>
    <li>Chemical Sunscreens</li>
    <li>Silicones</li>
    <li>Fragrance + Dyes</li>
    <li>Sodium Lauryl Sulfate</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Below is are links to where you can find more out about drunk
    elephant or purchase it. If you want more information you can 
    access it via their own website but if you are looking to buy
    something from the UK, the Sephora website would be more helpful.
    You can find Drunk Elephant in SpaceNK shops in England, or if you
    are shopping from America, you can view Drunk Elephant in Ulta
    Beauty stores.

  <mark><strong>Drunk Elephant B-Hydra Serum</strong></mark>
<p><img src="drunkelephantbhydraserum.jpg" alt="Drunk Elephant" style="float:left;width:200px;height:200px;">
   I recommend the Drunk Elephant B-Hydra Intensive Serum for younger skin
   because it is really just a hydrating juice! There are no harsh chemicals
   or retinols inside and it will give your skin a bouncy glow. It is a very 
   good serum to try in a skincare smoothie with one of their moisturisers 
   since it is a smooth gel and will cool or refresh your skin. It would 
   normally cost £43 but prices can vary from websites, I definitely believe 
   that this product is worth your money and is a staple in a skincare 
   routine. The packaging is similar to the rest of the Drunk Elephant 
   line, mainly white with a different colour lid. A good marketing pull on 
   this item is the satisfying click-twist top - to open the product you spin 
   the top round and a pump will emerge, alowing you to squeeze the serum out.
   This is the same as the Drunk Elephant eye balms and other serums such as the 
   C-Firma Fresh Day Serum and T.L.C Framboos Glycolic Night Serum. This product 
   will benefit you if you:
  <li>Have dry skin</li>
  <li>Need a refreshing boost</li>
  <li>Have dull skin</li>
  <br>
  To wrap things up, the Drunk Elephant B-Hydra Serum is a good option for young skin and is really a harmless
  serum that will benefit your skin in the future. it is suitable for everyday usage and is great mixed in with their
  moisturisers, specifically the Protini Polypeptide Cream. But it is also great by itself for a refreshed glow.

  <mark><strong>Drunk Elephant Virgin Marula Oil</strong></mark>
  <p><img src="drunkelephantvirginmarulaoil.jpg" alt="Drunk Elephant" style="float:right;width:200px;height:200px;">
    This Drunk Elephant Virgin Marula Oil is pricey for it's size but it is a very underestimated product. It is mainly white
    but has a bright lime yellow lip with an attached pipete to release the oil into your hand or onto a moisturiser for 
    a skincare smoothie! Yes that's right, it is also compatible with their Protini Polypeptide Cream, La La Retro Moisturiser
    and even their new Bora Barrier Repair Cream! It is able to purchse in a 15ml size for £35 or a £0ml size for £64. It is 
    probably worth trying out the smaller size first to test to see if it works for your skin before spending a larger amount
    on a bigger portion but this oil is suitable for many different types of skin so hopefully it will do the job. Many people
    associate this oil with their other retinol oil and say that you shouldn't use the Virgin Marula Oil, however this oil is actually 
    ok for young skin just do not use an excessive amount of it. This product will be helpful for your skin if you have:
    <li>Oily skin</li>
    <li>Acne prone areas</li>
    <li>Combination Skin</li>
    <br>
    In conclusion, this product can be evry helpful for young skin that may be developing or going through acne and will definitely
    be worth it in the long term. On young skin, this product does not need to be used every day and it's a better idea to use it once every
    two days since this also means that the product will last longer!

    <mark><strong>Drunk Elephant includes some ingredients that are more suited for aging, matured skin. One of the significant ones being retinol:</strong></mark>
    <p><img src="drunkelephantretinol.jpg" alt="Drunk Elephant" style="float:left;width:200px;height:200px;">
      This Drunk Elephant Retinol Serum is definitely not suitable for young skin that has not yet matured since the key ingredient is retinol
      and that is meant for reversing or preventing looks of aging skin. There have been a lot of videos recently about children going into shops
      like SpaceNK and Sephora and asking for the retinol since they believe it is cool and the brand is trending. However, it has now become a trend
      that people film these 'ten year old girls' in the shop and post it on a social media platform with nasty comments. Children do not realise how this can be
      damaging for their skin in the long run and awareness needs to be raised about this particular ingredient not being appropriate for young skin.
      They believe that they are helping their skin but they are really just adding thick layers of chemicals onto their face. If you hear a friend talking about
      purchasing any item with retinol in it, but specifically one of the Drunk Elephant items, warn them against it and read the ingredients in your own
      skincare products before aplying them. Please only use retinol on your face if you:
      <li>Have been prescribed by a doctor</li>
      <li>Are over the age of 20</li>
      <br>
      To summarise, both the Drunk Elephant retinol serum and oil are only meant for aging skin over the age of 20 and even then should
      only be applied in small proportions. It is important to not damage your skin with this and to tell your friends the dangers of 
      applying this very strong chemical on their young and glowing faces.
