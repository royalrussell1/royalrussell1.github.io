  A Guinness World Record holder for completing 4,030 pull-ups in 17 hours, and as one of the world’s top endurance
  athletes, having competed in more than 60 ultra-marathons, triathlons and ultra-triathlons; Goggins.
  Before any of these achievements, Goggins was making $1,000 a month working as an exterminator and
  living paycheck-to-paycheck. He was also out of shape, weighing nearly 300 pounds.
  Every day, at the end of his 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift, he would stop at a restaraunt called Steak ’n Shake:
  “I would go in and get a large chocolate milkshake,”
  He tells us. “And then I would go across the street to 7-Eleven, get a box of mini donuts.”
  On his 45 minute commute home, he’d “pop donuts like Tic Tacs.”

  As soon as he got home, he’d turn on the TV and blast the volume so he could hear it while he showered.
  That was his routine up until one morning, when he heard a program about Navy SEAL training, he remembers: “Here I am
  listening to the TV as I’m showering and, lo and behold, this particular day, I started hearing: ‘Navy SEALs. Toughest
  training.’ I was hearing it cut out between the water hitting my ears.”
  He got out of the shower, watched the remainder of the episode and that’s when, he says, “I got sick of being haunted
  by being nobody.”
  He realized that “I didn’t want to sit back and continually watch these shows about great people doing amazing things.
  I wanted that feeling in my head that I believed that they had: of true accomplishment.”
  Goggins, who was 24 years old at the time, decided that he wanted to become a SEAL himself.
  He had experience in the military, and he’d been in the Air Force from age 19 to 23 — but enlisting as a SEAL requires
  completing one of the military’s most grueling training programs.
